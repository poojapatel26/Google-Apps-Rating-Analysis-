## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Google Play Store Apps dataset to better understand:

1 How do the app ratings differ between paid and free apps in general?

2 How does the ratings differ in general?

## File Descriptions

There are two files, one notebook gives answers to all the above questions and it also predict the App ratings and another contains the dataset csv file.
